# PatternPath - Learn once, revise forever

PatternPath is a **free, pattern-based learning platform** built for engineering students who want real understanding, long-term retention, and interview readiness without selling courses, certificates, or locking content behind paywalls.

Instead of focusing on course completion, PatternPath helps learners **master problem-solving patterns**, **track weak areas**, and **revise intelligently over time**.

---

## Why PatternPath?

Most learning platforms optimize for:
- Watching videos
- Completing courses
- Selling certificates

But students fail interviews because they:
- Don’t recognize patterns in problems
- Forget what they learned after a few weeks
- Don’t revise systematically

PatternPath is built on a simple belief:

> **Learning once is not enough — retention and revision matter more than completion.**

---

## Core Philosophy

PatternPath follows a practical, student-first approach:

- **Patterns over playlists**  
  Learn reusable problem-solving approaches instead of isolated topics.

- **Revision over repetition**  
  Focus on revising what you forget, not rewatching everything.

- **Understanding over certificates**  
  No paid certificates or fake signals.

- **Free content, paid leverage**  
  Learning material is always free; optional human support is paid.

---

## How It Works

PatternPath replaces traditional courses with **pattern-based learning**.

Each pattern includes:
- What problem it solves
- How to recognize when to use it
- Standard approach and mental checklist
- Common mistakes
- Practice problems
- Confidence self-assessment (Weak / Medium / Strong)

The system tracks:
- Pattern confidence
- Revision history
- Weak areas

Users receive reminders to **revise patterns they are likely to forget**, helping build long-term mastery.

## Key Features

- Pattern-based learning (starting with DSA)
- Confidence-based progress tracking
- Intelligent revision reminders
- Simple, distraction-free interface
- Community discussions around patterns
- Optional accountability and mentorship features

---

## Monetization

PatternPath does **not sell learning content**.

Optional paid features include:
- Accountability pods (small study groups with goals)
- Mentor office hours
- Mock interviews with real engineers

Students who never pay still get **full access to all learning material**.
